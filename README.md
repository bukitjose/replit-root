# Root Replit

<p>Root Replit is a project that makes you do more at your replit, like see system files, create files in a system directory, etc.</p>

# Warning

This project is still in beta, note that if you want to be a superuser, you can't because its protected with password, the IT/Administrator of replit has secure the root password so i don't know the password of it i try brute-force but still doesn't work at all, but you can try to crack the password too just type `su` on your replit terminal and good luck. but DON'T DELETE RUNNER FOLDER OR YOUR REPLIT WON'T WORK ANYMORE

**THIS PROJECT IS ONLY TO ROOT PHP WEB SERVER REPL**

# Tutorial

<p>To root or gain access to the system, we need to prepare the repl first. For example, you make a PHP web server, and then you can root the repl using the tutorial below.</p>

**Clone Script**

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/bukitjose/replit-root.git
cd replit-root
```
<p>After you clone the script you need to copy the indosec.php to the main folder where all your main file there (outside the replit-root folder)</p>

**Testing the shell**
<p>To test the shell you can go to your repl website and add /indosec.php after the website url, example: www.yourrepl.com/indosec.php if its success it will require a password, the password is: IndoSec</p>

**Exploiting the system**
<p>Next we have to exploit the system using the shell so from shell you can see many info like ip address, folder/file, or even can run a command</p>

**Thats it**
<p>Thats it you have successfully root your system, in the basic terms "Root" is gaining access to system files which give the user freedom to add/remove file, administrative permission, etc</p>

**Extension**
If you still want more, you can install Metasploit too by typing `msfconsole` in the shell (the shell in the replit dashboard), and it will install Metasploit on your replit.

**Reverse Shell**
<p>If you still want to reverse shell the system you can use popular reverse shell tools like p0wny-shell: https://github.com/flozz/p0wny-shell</p>

**Other Root Project**
<p>If you want to try other root project you can try https://github.com/techcode1001/replit_root</p>

**Recovery**
<p>I don't know why i just want to make recovery in python so if you want to go to recovery like rooting a phone you can use the recovery.py file that you cloned from this github. (Its just for fun)</p>

**Special Thanks**
<p>Thank you to all the programmers who coded indosec.php. It's very useful.</p>

**Have fun**

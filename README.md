# Root Replit

# About

<p>Root Replit is a project that make you can do more at your replit like see system files/creating files in a system directory, etc</p>

# Warning

<p>This project is still in beta but you can try it but DON'T DELETE RUNNER FOLDER OR YOUR REPLIT WON'T WORK ANYMORE</p>

**THIS PROJECT IS ONLY TO ROOT PHP WEB SERVER REPL**

# Tutorial

<p>To root/gain access to the system, we need to prepare the repl first, for example you make php web server and then you can root the repl using tutorial below</p>

**Clone Script**

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/bukitjose/replit-root.git
cd replit-root
```
<p>After you clone the script you need to copy the indosec.php to the main folder where all your main file there (outside the replit-root folder)</p>

**Testing the shell**
<p>To test the shell you can go to your repl website and add /indosec.php after the website url, example: www.yourrepl.com/indosec.php if its success it will require a password, the password is: IndoSec</p>

**Exploiting the system**
<p>Next we have to exploit the system using the shell so from shell you can see many info like ip address, folder/file, or even can run a command</p>

**Thats it**
<p>Thats it you have successfully root your system, in the basic terms "Root" is gaining access to system files which we done before.</p>

**Extension**
<p>If you still want more you can install metasploit too by typing msfconsole in the shell (the shell in the replit dashboard) and it will install metasploit to your replit.</p>

**Recovery**
<p>I don't know why i just want to make recovery in python so if you want to go to recovery like rooting a phone you can use the recovery.py file that you cloned from this github.</p>

**Have fun**
